# Kid Activity Planner MVP

A specialized multi-agent system that discovers, curates, and schedules age-appropriate activities for children using the proven parallel-convergence architecture from the AI Trip Planner.

## 🎯 Features

- **Parallel Agent Architecture**: Events, Safety, and Schedule agents run simultaneously for optimal performance
- **Age-Appropriate Discovery**: Find activities specifically suited to your child's age and interests
- **Safety Validation**: Multi-layer safety checks including age appropriateness and accessibility
- **Schedule Optimization**: Match activities to your family's availability and preferences
- **Special Needs Support**: Accommodations for children with special requirements
- **Budget Optimization**: Filter activities by your budget preferences

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a parallel-convergence pattern with four specialized agents:

```
     START
       |
   [Parallel Execution]
   /   |   \
  /    |    \
Events Safety Schedule
  \    |    /
   \   |   /
   [Convergence]
       |
   Planner Agent
       |
      END
```

### Agents

1. **Events Agent**: Discovers local activities and events
2. **Safety Agent**: Validates age appropriateness and safety requirements
3. **Schedule Agent**: Optimizes timing and logistics
4. **Planner Agent**: Synthesizes all inputs into a final activity plan

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key or OpenRouter API key

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd kid-activity-planner
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8001
   - API docs: http://localhost:8001/docs

### Configuration

1. **Copy environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp backend/env_example.txt backend/.env
   ```

2. **Add your API keys to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   # Required (choose one)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   # OR
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
   
   # Optional (for observability)
   ARIZE_SPACE_ID=your_arize_space_id
   ARIZE_API_KEY=your_arize_api_key
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_kid_planner.py
```

This will test:
- Health endpoint
- Basic activity discovery
- Special needs support
- Schedule optimization
- Safety validation

## 📱 Usage

### Frontend Interface

1. **Enter child information:**
   - Age (1-17)
   - Location
   - Interests (optional)
   - Special needs (optional)

2. **Set preferences:**
   - Available days (weekends/weekdays)
   - Preferred times (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - Budget preference (budget/moderate/premium)

3. **Get personalized recommendations:**
   - Age-appropriate activities
   - Safety-validated options
   - Schedule-optimized timing
   - Budget-filtered results

### API Usage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:8001/discover-activities', json={
    "child_age": 8,
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "interests": ["science", "art"],
    "special_needs": [],
    "available_days": ["weekend"],
    "preferred_times": ["morning", "afternoon"],
    "budget_preference": "moderate"
})

data = response.json()
print(f"Found {data['total_found']} activities")
```

### Key Components

- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents for different aspects of activity planning
- **Tools**: Mock data and API integrations for real-world data
- **State Management**: TypedDict for managing information flow between agents
- **Parallel Execution**: LangGraph for optimal performance

### Adding New Features

1. **New Tools**: Add to the appropriate agent's tool list
2. **New Agents**: Add to the graph in `build_graph()`
3. **New Data Sources**: Integrate APIs in the tools
