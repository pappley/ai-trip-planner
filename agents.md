# AI Trip Planner - Agent Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AI Trip Planner uses a multi-agent system built with LangGraph to orchestrate specialized agents that work together to create personalized travel itineraries. The system employs a parallel execution model for optimal performance, with three information-gathering agents running simultaneously before converging into a final itinerary synthesis.

## Agent Architecture

### System Design

The system follows a **parallel-convergence pattern** where multiple specialized agents gather information simultaneously, then converge their findings into a comprehensive travel plan.

```
     START
       |
   [Parallel Execution]
   /   |   \
  /    |    \

  \    |    /
   \   |   /
   [Convergence]
       |
   Itinerary Agent
       |
      END
```

```

## State Management

### TripState Structure

The system uses a `TripState` TypedDict to manage information flow between agents:

```python
class TripState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    trip_request: Dict[str, Any]
    research: Optional[str]
    budget: Optional[str]
    local: Optional[str]
    final: Optional[str]
    tool_calls: Annotated[List[Dict[str, Any]], operator.add]
```

**State Fields**:
- `messages`: Conversation history and agent communications
- `trip_request`: Original user request (destination, duration, budget, interests, travel_style)
- `research`: Research agent output
- `budget`: Budget agent output
- `local`: Local agent output
- `final`: Final itinerary from itinerary agent
- `tool_calls`: Tracking of all tool executions for observability

### Prompt Engineering

Each agent has a specialized prompt template:

```python
# Research Agent
prompt_t = (
    "You are a research assistant.\n"
    "Gather essential information about {destination}.\n"
    "Use tools to get weather, visa, and essential info, then summarize."
)

# Budget Agent
prompt_t = (
    "You are a budget analyst.\n"
    "Analyze costs for {destination} over {duration} with budget: {budget}.\n"
    "Use tools to get pricing information, then provide a detailed breakdown."
)

# Local Agent
prompt_t = (
    "You are a local guide.\n"
    "Find authentic experiences in {destination} for someone interested in: {interests}.\n"
    "Travel style: {travel_style}. Use tools to gather local insights."
)

# Itinerary Agent
prompt_t = (
    "Create a {duration} itinerary for {destination} ({travel_style}).\n\n"
    "Inputs:\nResearch: {research}\nBudget: {budget}\nLocal: {local}\n"
)
```
